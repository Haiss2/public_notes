1. Describe a time when you were preparing for a happy event

## Part 3

- How can parents help children to get organized?

There are three main methods that parents can use.
First of all, parents should let their children know the important of being organized. 
They can tell some interesting stories and remind the kids to develop a good habit.

Secondly, parents teach their children how to break tasks into chunks and create a schedule for their daily routines. 
In this way, children won’t feel overwhelmed by their work.

Last but not least, parents must set up a good role model for the kids.
When children find that their parents are organized, 
they will copy their behaviors unconsciously.

- On what occasions do people need to be organized?

When people have to handle some important works, they need to be organized. 
By keeping organized, they will have more time to work on important tasks.
As organization can improve the flow of communication between people and their team, 
they can also make their team more productive. 
What’s more, if people want to keep a balance between work and life, they need to be organized, too. 
In this way, they can have extra time for themselves. Being organized reduces their stress and helps them keep a healthy life.


- Does everything need to be well prepared?

It's really depends.
When something unexpected happens, people have to change their plans. 
For some important things, people should get well prepared for them and make sure they won’t miss anything.
However, some minor routine tasks don’t need to be well prepared as people are familiar with them

- Do people need others' help when organizing things?

It's really depends.
For some important events, like meetings, parties or weddings, many hands make light work, 
people can complete their tasks successfully with others’ help. 
Of course, if people just organize their private things, such as a trip, or a family dinner, they may not need others’ help.

2. Describe a gift you would like to buy for your friend

## You should say:

- When it happened
- What gift it was
- Who you gave it to
- And explain why you chose that gift

## Part 3

- When do people normally send gifts to others?
  It is a common practice to send gifts on a person’s special day such as their birthday and graduation ceremony. In my country, people also give bouquets and flower baskets to new business owners to wish them good luck and show support. Personally, I travel a lot and like to bring back snacks and souvenirs to give to my friends.
  There is not fixed occasions,whenever people can send gift for others person It is usually a person special, achive the  goal,or simple is a boy/ a girl fall in love with an other.For me, I usually give a gift for my family and my friends at their birthday 
- Do people give gifts or red packets on traditional festivals?
  From my own experience, red envelopes containing lucky money are typically given to young children by the adults in their family only at Tet, which is the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. Sometimes, they are given to commemorate life milestones such as a baby’s first birthday. However, I’ve rarely seen it on other occasions.
  It really depends on the country
  In vietnam , in lunar new years the adults give the red packet which is containing lucky money for the childrent and the older to wish to a bring goods things and luck in new year
In others country in europe, in christmas, people usally give gifts together

- Is it easy to choose clothes as gifts?
  I don’t think that is the case at all. On the contrary, choosing clothes as gifts requires you to know a lot about the recipient. Not only do you have to know what style that person likes, you also have to know about certain body measurements. Such information is sensitive and can be awkward if you ask them for it. So, unless you know the person really well, picking clothes to give them can be rather hard.
- Will people feel happy when receiving an expensive gift?
  While it can be true, I don’t think the value of the gift depends solely on how expensive it is. In choosing a gift, the giver should wonder what the gift would mean to the recipient to show that they care. It’s easy to buy an expensive present if you have a lot of money. However, people generally prefer a gift that has sentimental value. For instance, my father always tells me that he liked the shirt I used my first month’s salary to get him the most even though he has many more expensive one.
